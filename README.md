  ```
- 💻 A Salesforce project open in **VS Code**.

## 🚀 Usage

1. 🎯 Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`).
2. Run one of the following commands:
   - **`SF Assistant: Run SOQL Query`** → execute a query and view results.
   - **`SF Assistant: Object Explorer`** → browse objects and fields.
   - **`SF Assistant: Clear Cache`** → clear cached metadata.
3. ✍️ Enter your SOQL query or browse metadata.
4. 👀 View results in the interactive table webview.
5. 📤 Use export buttons to download results as **CSV** or **JSON**.

##### Example query:

1. Simple query:

```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Type FROM Account WHERE CreatedDate = LAST_N_DAYS:30 LIMIT 10
```

2. Aggregate Query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(Id), Type FROM Account GROUP BY Type LIMIT 10
```

3. Nested Query:

```sql
SELECT Id, Name, (SELECT Id, StageName FROM Opportunities)
FROM Account
WHERE CreatedDate = LAST_N_DAYS:30
LIMIT 10
```

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts (Keybindings)

You can configure your own shortcuts in VS Code under  
`File → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts` (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`).
